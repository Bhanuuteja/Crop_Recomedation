## ‚ú® Features

  * **Crop Prediction:** Recommends suitable crops based on user input for:
      * Nitrogen ($N$)
      * Phosphorus ($P$)
      * Potassium ($K$)
      * Temperature
      * Humidity
      * Soil pH
      * Rainfall
  * **User-Friendly Interface:** An interactive and easy-to-use web interface powered by Streamlit.
  * **Data-Driven:** Utilizes a dataset of crop and environmental data to train a robust prediction model.
